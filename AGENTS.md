# Agent instructions

This repo is the factory-game-v3 Rust/Bevy factory game. The Unity-to-Rust migration is complete: the C# surface and the Unity asset tree are both gone, recorded in [docs/unity-parity.md](docs/unity-parity.md). Runtime art the game actually uses lives in the crate that renders it.

## Scope

- The Rust workspace under `crates/` is the product. Build features there.
- Art the game renders belongs to the crate that renders it, under `crates/factory_shell/assets/`. Do not reintroduce an engine-shaped asset tree at the repo root.
- `.gitattributes` sends large binary art to LFS and keeps the small runtime sprites in ordinary Git so the viewer builds from a plain clone. Change it only when an issue says to.

## Project shape

- `crates/` holds the Rust workspace: `factory_content` (catalog), `factory_sim` (authority), `factory_cli` (headless runner), `factory_shell` (Bevy viewer, native and Wasm).
- `scripts/` holds the test gate, the Trunk web build, and the trusted image publisher. `Dockerfile` and `nginx.conf` build and serve the browser bundle.
- `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/FEATURES.md`, and the `justfile` are the repo-local baseline trio plus command surface.

## Repo boundaries

- Keep gameplay and its art in `crates/`. The repo root carries build, deploy, and docs, not game content.
- `coilyco-bridge/deploy` owns rollout, the pull credential, and public exposure. This repo owns the image and the workflow that publishes it.

### The simulation owns logic

New gameplay features are implemented in the simulation and CLI layer. The
presentation layer does not get its own branch of logic.

- `factory_sim` owns authority. Every rule, state transition, and edit validation lands here.
- `factory_cli` exercises those rules headlessly. A feature the runner cannot reach is a feature no determinism proof covers.
- `factory_shell` projects immutable snapshots and sends explicit edit commands back. It decides how the world looks, never what the world does.

State flows one way. The sim produces a snapshot, the shell draws it, the shell
sends a command, the sim decides. A snapshot is never fed back in as input, and
a snapshot type is never a save format or a source of truth.

When a feature needs a new rule, the rule lands in the sim and the shell learns
to draw it. Never the reverse. Logic that lives only in the shell is invisible
to `just cargo-run` and to every `factory_sim` test, which is where this
repo keeps its proofs.

## Commands

- Route dev commands through ward.
- `just test` is the gate: the pre-commit baseline plus the Rust workspace tests, under a bounded timeout. CI calls `bash scripts/test-gate.sh` directly because repo verbs require a tracked branch.
- `just cargo-run` runs a headless scenario, `play` the compact loop over line-oriented JSON, `shell-run` the native viewer, `shell-serve` and `shell-build-web` the browser bundle, `image-build` and `check-publish` the deploy surface, `v2-liveness` the sustained-operation proof.
- Enumerate the full set in the [`justfile`](justfile), and add a verb there before invoking it.

## Validation

- Run `just test` for the repo baseline, including the Rust workspace.
- Run `just image-build` when changing the web image or publish workflow.
- Run `just check-publish` when changing the Forgejo OCI publisher.
- Run `pre-commit run --all-files` before committing.
- Keep [README.md](README.md), this file, and [docs/FEATURES.md](docs/FEATURES.md) in sync when the repo surface changes.

## Safety

- Keep tracked text public-safe.
- Keep repo-local baseline exceptions narrow and documented in the lowest config layer that can express them.

## Cross-repo contracts

- Keep baseline exclusions narrow and documented.
- The catalog pre-commit hooks are authored in `coilyco-flight-deck/agentic-os`. Fix a validator there rather than working around it here.
- Use the shared agentic-os conventions when the repo adopts a new managed-repo surface.

## Release

- Source CI publishes the private Bevy/Wasm web image to
  `forgejo.coilysiren.me/coilyco-gaming/factory-game-v3:<full-source-sha>`.
- The trusted deploy runner supplies the package write credential as
  `REGISTRY_TOKEN`.
- `coilyco-bridge/deploy` owns rollout, the read-only `forgejo-registry`
  pull secret, and the public ingress.
- Land image and workflow changes together so the deploy contract stays complete.

## Agent rules

<!-- BEGIN managed by agentic-os/scripts/apply-git-workflow.py -->
### Git workflow

**This repo runs the `pull-request-and-merge` lane**, declared as `ward.workflow` in this file's frontmatter. The agent commits to a task branch, pushes it, opens a Forgejo pull request, and **merges that pull request itself** once it is green. The author of the code is the one who merges it. Opening the pull request is a step, never the stopping point.

The fleet runs one lane, and it authorizes the agent end to end. Pushing straight to `main` is over: `merge-remote-main` is retired, so no repo can declare its way back to one.

* `pull-request-and-merge` - the agent commits to a task branch, pushes it, opens a pull request, and merges that pull request itself once it is green.

**Every lane slug names what the AGENT does, never what someone else does.** `pull-request-and-merge` carries the merge because the agent that authored the code merges its own pull request. `pull-request` drops `-and-merge` because the author stops at the pull request and the director merge lane takes over. Reading `pull-request-and-merge` as "someone else merges it later" inverts the two and leaves finished work sitting unmerged.

**These actions are pre-authorized on every lane, and the agent MUST take them without asking first.** Committing, creating a branch, pushing a branch, pushing the lane's own destination, and opening a pull request are ordinary reversible work, not the destructive wall that earns a question. Stopping to ask is how a turn ends with the work stranded in a dirty worktree.

* **ALWAYS commit** in-scope work and **ALWAYS push** it to the canonical remote before pausing, reporting a checkpoint, handing off, or ending a turn. A local-only commit is not a checkpoint.
* **ALWAYS open the pull request** in the same turn as the branch's first push, on every lane except `remote-branch-only`. A pushed branch with no pull request is litter nobody reviews.
* **NEVER `--no-verify`** and **NEVER force-push**. Those two are the real walls, and they stay closed.
* **ALWAYS merge your own pull request on `pull-request-and-merge`**, in the same turn, as soon as it is green. Reporting it as open and awaiting someone is the failure this lane exists to prevent.
* **NEVER merge on `pull-request` or `remote-branch-only`.** Those two stop where they stop, and the director merge lane carries a `pull-request` from there.

- Prefer the smallest local exclusion that makes the managed hooks reflect the real repo surface.
- Bump `COMPACT_SAVE_VERSION` in the same commit that changes the compact save shape. See [docs/compact-persistence.md](docs/compact-persistence.md).

## Checkout residency

This repo is not in Agent Compose's `repository-plan.yaml`, so it has no
resident checkout under `~/projects/<owner>/`. That is intentional. Work it
from a task-scoped temporary clone, and remove that clone once the work lands.

A temporary root can be purged at any time, so commit and push before pausing,
switching tasks, or ending a session. The remote is the only durable artifact.
