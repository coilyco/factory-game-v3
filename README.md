# Factory Game V3

This repository ships the Rust/Bevy factory simulation and browser viewer.
Runtime art lives with the viewer in `crates/factory_shell/assets/`.

## Validation

Run the lightweight migration baseline through ward:

```bash
just test
```

That verb runs the repo's pre-commit baseline and Rust workspace tests with a
bounded timeout. CI calls the same bounded script directly because ward repo
verbs require a tracked branch.

The headless Rust slice can also run directly:

```bash
just cargo-run run --scenario iron-bars --ticks 6
```

The compact game is playable headlessly over a line-oriented JSON protocol,
one request per line in and one response per line out:

```bash
just play
```

See [docs/headless-play.md](docs/headless-play.md) for the request and
response shapes.

## Deployment

Source CI builds the repo-root Dockerfile and publishes
`forgejo.coilysiren.me/coilyco-gaming/factory-game-v3:<full-source-sha>` as a
private Forgejo package on every push to `main`.
The image packages the Trunk-built Wasm bundle behind unprivileged nginx.
`coilyco-bridge/deploy` owns the public chart, rollout, and its separate
read-only `forgejo-registry` pull credential.

Validate the image locally through Ward:

```bash
just check-publish
just image-build
```

audit, [docs/v3-worlds.md](docs/v3-worlds.md) for the retained game-scale fixtures, and

claims. Remote power expansion is covered in
[docs/deployment-radar.md](docs/deployment-radar.md), and the post-starter
power proof is in [docs/v3-worlds.md](docs/v3-worlds.md).
